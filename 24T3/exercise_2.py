# You can assume that the argument L to positive_gaps()
# is a list of integers.
# 
# Records all gaps between two SUCCESSIVE members of L,
# say a and b, such that b is STRICTLY GREATER than a.
#
# Gap values are output from smallest to largest.
#
# For a given gap value, gaps for that value are output
# from smallest to largest starts of gap, without repetition,
# with 2 spaces before "Between".
