# You can assume that the argument to solve() is of the form
# x+y=z where:
# - x, y and z are NONEMPTY sequences of UNDERSCORES and DIGITS;
# - there can be any number of spaces (possibly none) before x,
#   between x and +, between + and y, between y and =, between = and z,
#   and after z.
#
# ALL OCCURRENCES OF _ ARE MEANT TO BE REPLACED BY THE SAME DIGIT.
#
# Note that sequences of digits such as 000 and 00037 represent
# 0 and 37, consistently with what int('000') and int('00037') return,
# respectively.
#
# When there is more than one solution, solutions are output from
# smallest to largest values of _.
#
# Note that an equation is always output with a single space before and after
# + and =, with no leading nor trailing spaces, and without extra leading 0s
# in front of an integer.
#
# Hint: The earlier you process underscores, the easier,
#       and recall what dir(str) can do for you.
